# Accessibility Statement

This template aims to provide an accessible experience for all users, regardless of ability or technology. We've designed this template to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards.

The JavaScript-free implementation ensures compatibility with assistive technologies and browsers where JavaScript may be disabled or unsupported.

## Accessibility Features

### Perceivable

- **Color Contrast**: All text meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Dark Mode**: Reduces eye strain and helps users with light sensitivity
