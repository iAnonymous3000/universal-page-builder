# Privacy Policy

The Universal Page Builder is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe that your website visitors should not be tracked without their explicit consent.

This JavaScript-free implementation further enhances privacy by eliminating all client-side scripting.

## Privacy-First Approach

Our template provides maximum privacy protection through:

- **No JavaScript**: Complete elimination of all client-side scripting eliminates multiple privacy threats
- **No Cookies**: No cookies are set at any time
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect or transmit any user data
- **No Third-Party Requests**: All resources are served locally from your domain
- **No Fingerprinting**: No device fingerprinting mechanisms possible without JavaScript
- **No Analytics**: No built-in analytics or tracking
- **Content Security Policy**: Headers prevent inclusion of external resources

## No Client-Side Storage

Unlike JavaScript-based templates, this version uses no localStorage or sessionStorage:

- Theme preferences are controlled via CSS-only toggles without persistence
- No client-side data storage of any kind
- No cookies or web storage APIs are used

This ensures maximum privacy as no data is stored on the user's device.

## Font Privacy

Instead of using hosted web fonts like Google Fonts (which can track users), this template:

1. Uses system fonts by default
2. If you choose to add custom fonts, we recommend self-hosting them

## Benefits of a JavaScript-Free Approach

Removing JavaScript provides significant privacy advantages:

- **No Request Headers**: Reduces information leaked through HTTP headers
- **No Browser API Access**: JavaScript can't access browser information, geolocation, etc.
- **No DOM Fingerprinting**: Can't build unique browser fingerprints
- **No Tracking Libraries**: Can't add third-party analytics or trackers
- **No XSS Vulnerabilities**: Cross-site scripting attacks require JavaScript
- **No Event Tracking**: No way to monitor clicks, form inputs, scrolling behavior

## Privacy When Extending

If you extend this template, we recommend maintaining these privacy principles:

- Avoid adding JavaScript whenever possible
- If you need analytics, consider privacy-friendly alternatives like server-side analytics
- Self-host all resources whenever possible
- Use standard HTML forms rather than third-party form providers
- Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent unauthorized scripts
- Make privacy a feature of your site, not an afterthought

## GDPR, CCPA, and ePrivacy Compliance

This template is designed to help you build websites that can comply with major privacy regulations:

- **GDPR**: With no tracking or data collection, compliance is significantly simplified
- **CCPA**: No personal information is collected or sold
- **ePrivacy**: No cookies means no cookie banner is required in most cases

For jurisdictions requiring disclosures even in the absence of tracking, consider adding a simple privacy statement to your footer.

## Privacy as a Feature

We believe privacy is a feature, not a burden. By using this template, you're providing your visitors with:

- Faster page loads
- Reduced mobile data usage
- Better battery life on mobile devices
- Freedom from tracking and surveillance
- A more ethical web experience

*Note: While this template is designed to prioritize privacy, your specific implementation (content, hosting, etc.) may introduce additional privacy considerations. Always review your complete implementation for privacy implications.*
